# Project Initial Design

1. Summarize in words and pictures what your project purpose and goals are (other students will see this as well and it will help them quickly grasp the purpose of you project).
2. Sketch your initial thinking on your ERD and the data your project will be accessing and using
3. Sketch rough system design of your project, what are the technologies and pieces (shapes) and interactions (arrows)
4. Make initial goals for where you want your project to be at each day until the end of class.

Please include any additional relevant information you'd like to include or have. If you project has UX maybe you could have some rough sketch of that as well.
