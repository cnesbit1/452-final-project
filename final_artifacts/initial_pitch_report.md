# Job Application Tracker

Having trouble keeping track of what jobs you've applied for? Wishing you could see stats for how well companies respond to applicants? Want all this in a handy Chrome extension? Katherine Greer, Connor Nesbit, and I propose our project.

Our Chrome extension will allow users to track any job they have applied for. It will scrape the site where the application is sent for the company name, job title, etc and allow the user to update the status to track whether they have been reached out to or ghosted.

We will also allow users to upload documents such as resumes to keep them all in one convenient place. We will use a SQL database which will reference an S3 bucket for the documents that are uploaded. Our service and frontend code will be served up through the Chrome store.

We have created a timeline, focusing on one feature to implement per week, ensuring that we will have a working application by December 1st.
